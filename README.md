Hey there! I'm **Agon**, a 12-year-old **frontend web developer** and student at **J-coders Academy** from **Kosovo**.  
I’ve been coding for around **5 years**, starting from curiosity and growing into a passion for creating beautiful and interactive web experiences.  

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring design ideas, playing games, and learning new web technologies.  
That’s me in a nutshell! <br/><br/>

There’s still a lot more I’m building — every project helps me grow as a developer and creator.<br/><br/>
